        <h3>What was the purpose of the project?</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this study was to investigate how effectively someone
          with high levels of ADHD traits can complete cognitive tasks and how
          their cognitive abilities differ from those with low levels of ADHD
          traits, and how this may differ between gender.

        <h3>How will I find out about the results?</h3>
        <p>
          Once the study has been completed, the researcher will prepare a
          general summary of the findings that will be ready around 12/04/2023.
          If you would like a copy of this general summary, please email the

          If I change my mind and wish to withdraw the information I have

        <p>
          If for any reason, you wish to withdraw your data please contact the
          investigator within two weeks of your participation. After this date,
          it might not be possible to withdraw your individual data as the
